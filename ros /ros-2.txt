Ros 1 - Though ROS-1 has given us the liberty of communicating with complex hardware and
software components with ease, there are some intricacies involved while producing them
as a product. For instance, let's say that, in the manufacturing industry, there is a swarm of
heterogeneous robots (robots of different typesâ€”say, mobile robots, robot arms, and so on).
It is quite difficult to establish communication between them due to the way ROS-1 is
architectured. This is because ROS-1 doesn't support the multi master concept.
